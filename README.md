# oeis-msdos
Programs to generate integer sequences found in oeis, using ms-dos, with Borland C++ and TASM

Compile display.asm, gcf.asm, and totient.asm with tasm.

Compile .asm files for sequences with, for instance, tasm a000018m.asm, and then then tlink a000018m display

For c code, compile with bcc, for instance bcc a000040c.bcc - this will produce the executable .exe directly
